This project is based on SpringBoot, MySQL, Redis, and is a system that integrates multiple functions such as user evaluation, merchant information display, coupon management, and flash sale activities. By making reasonable use of Redis' high performance, high concurrency and other features, the requirements in the project can be well met. At the same time, attention should be paid to issues related to database design, code implementation, performance optimization, and security assurance to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
